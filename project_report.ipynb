    "## 1. Introduction ##\n",
    "In this project, I created an optimization model to calculate the value of the assets in a dynasty fantasy football trade. The goal is to see which side of the trade contains more value, or which side \"wins\" the trade. I also created a second model to generate a fair trade counteroffer to the user's input offer based on the asset values generated with the first model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In \"regular\" fantasy football, a group of 8-12 people draft teams of NFL offensive players. These teams compete in head-to-head matchups for a period of fourteen weeks. After fourteen weeks, the top teams compete in a three-week playoff tournament, where one team is crowned champion. A fantasy football starting lineup varies depending on the format of the league and can consist of 1-2 quarterbacks, 2 running backs, 2-3 wide receivers, 1 tight end, and 1-2 flex spots. A flex spot can hold a running back, wide receiver, or tight end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynasty fantasy football differs from \"regular\" fantasy football in that dynasty managers keep the same players from year to year. Furthermore, dynasty fantasy football has yearly rookie drafts where each team drafts several of that year's NFL rookie players onto their teams. The order of these drafts is decided based on the previous year's standings. Given that teams are left with the same players year after year, trading is vital. Every league member chooses a different strategy. Some dynasty managers build young rosters looking for longevity, while others look to build older rosters full of household names. The purpose of a trade analyzer is to see which team is \"winning\" a potential trade or if a trade is even. Analyzing trade value through the unbiased form of a computer-generated model can take away the bias a player may have towards certain types of players, such as flashy or young players. Over time, it can help a manager's team accrue more value by consistently making trades that are even or that they're projected to \"win.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project consists of 3,532 trades that happened from April 10 to April 30 in 12-team, two-quarterback dynasty leagues. The dataset was scraped from [fantasycalc.com](https://www.fantasycalc.com/database). The trades consist of two sides, with a maximum of four pieces per side. The pieces consist of NFL offensive players or rookie draft picks."

    "The first model's objective is to minimize the total squared difference between the value of two sides of a trade. This is done across all 3,532 example trades in the dataset. The two sides of a trade are denoted as side \"A\" and side \"B\". The value of one side of a trade is defined as the sum of the values/weights of the assets on that side of the trade. The individual asset values/weights are denoted as $w_i$. Note that an asset is a player or rookie draft pick. The number of assets on side A of a trade ($\\text{n_assets_A}_i$) and the number of assets on side B of a trade ($\\text{n_assets_B}_i$) vary depending on the trade. However, trades in the dataset are constrained to a maximum of four assets per side. The assumption is made that no asset has a value of zero, so the weights have a lower-bound of one in order to prevent the model from bringing asset values to zero."

    "The second model is using the asset values, or weights, generated from model 1 to output a counter offer closest in total value to a given an input offer. It seeks to minimize the magnitude of the difference in value between the input offer and generated counter offer. The asset weights/values are denoted as $w_i$. A binary value $y_i$ is used to denote if an asset was included in the input offer, and is a 209 element vector for each possible player and rookie draft pick. The variable $y_i$ is one if that corresponding player/pick is in the input offer, and zero otherwise. The variable $x_i$ is simular to $y_i$, except it is selected in order to minimize the objective. This 209 element vector, $x_i$, acts as an indicator variable to denote if an asset should be included in the counter offer. The model is solving for the optimal combination of players not in the input offer closest to the input offer value. The model is constrained to returning a combination of players/picks equal to the number of players/picks decided by the user with the \"n_assets_in_counter\" variable."

In the future, one could reformulate the problem to generate a unique value/weight for every player/pick. This could be done by adding a constraints where the weight of the $i^{th}$ element must be greater than or equal to the $(i+1)^{th}$ element plus some small number.\n",
